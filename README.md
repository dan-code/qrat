SQRAT - Secure Quick and Reliable Authentication Tool

SQRAT is a Linux implementation of the <a href="https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm">SQRL protocol</a>. In its initial stages it is intended as an offline authentication tool to login into a local Linux machine.

In later stages full funcionality will be added for the software to also be used, as originally intended by the protocol, as an online authentication mechanism. 

In the long term extra funcionality will be added to be able to use SQRAT as a login mechanism in a corporate environment using the organizations private or public network.
